# SET card game

I'm recreating the card game SET in Unity. Currently, this repo only contains the basic flow and state of the game. I have a separate project that does brute force calculations on finding SETs automatically, which I intend to implement soon and use for: 
- aiding the player with hints
- creating simple AI players to play SET against 
- track stats on SETs the player finds, give feedback (for example, "Out of the SETs you've called, 56% have {so and so features}," which may help a player understand a weakness or strength in their game perception)

I do intend on releasing a playable version of this project for legal reasons. The code here is for educational purposes only.

This a personal project. My purpose is to get a better understanding of finite state machines, and Unity UI. I may try the new preview UI package, but for now I'm using the oringial UI system.
